# Microservices Architecture with Node.js and React

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture implemented with Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. The system includes four key microservices:

- **User Service** - Manages user-related operations.
- **Order Service** - Manages orders and related tasks.
- **Inventory Service** - Tracks inventory levels.
- **API Gateway** - Acts as a gateway to route requests to the appropriate services.
- **Frontend** - A React application that interacts with the backend services via the API Gateway.

## Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is broken down into smaller, modular services.
- **API Gateway**: Serves as a single entry point for all client requests.
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamically registers and discovers services using a discovery server.
- **Scalable and Fault-Tolerant**: Ensures high availability by isolating failures in individual services.
- **Frontend with React**: Displays user, order, and inventory data from the backend services.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** for backend microservices.
- **Express.js** for building APIs.
- **Axios** for HTTP requests from the frontend.
- **React** for building the user interface.
- **Consul** (or any discovery server) for service registration and discovery.
